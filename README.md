This app is scripted to to generate a random password for you.
Click the button to start the function and choose how many characters long you want the password to be.

- You are allowed to enable the following character options should you choose:
    - Uppercase alphabet
    - Lowercase alphabet
    - special characters
    - digits 0-9 

Make your way through the prompts and your password will display in the center of the screen

## Known Bugs

If you spam non-numeric entries into the first prompt that tells you to pick a number 8-128, the browser will occasionally fall behind and pass an entry that otherwise would not have been allowed.

The same is true on the same prompt if you enter choices too quickly in general.

If you do not enable at least one of the character options you will not get a password. Please go back and choose an alphabet.
